# CryptoClustering
Data was prepared using the Stadard Scaler function, and then the best value for 'k' was determined using the original scaled data. Clusters were then plotted using the results.

Clusters were then optimized using Principal Cluster Analysis (PCA). 'k' was plotted using the PCA data to determine the best number of clusters to use, and then clusters were plotted using this information
